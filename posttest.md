### Q1. Which of the following indicates atrioventricular conduction delay in an ECG?

a) Prolonged QRS complex  
b) Prolonged PR interval  
c) Elevated ST segment  
d) Inverted T wave  

### Q2. Why is the QRS complex narrower and sharper compared to the P wave?

a) Ventricular repolarization is slower  
b) Ventricular depolarization is faster and stronger  
c) Atria are electrically larger  
d) Due to baseline wandering  

### Q3. What part of the heart’s conduction system delays signal transmission to allow ventricular filling?

a) SA node  
b) Purkinje fibers  
c) AV node  
d) Aortic valve  

### Q4. If you observe 50 Hz noise in an ECG signal during acquisition, the most probable cause is:

a) Muscle tremor  
b) Lead reversal  
c) Power-line interference  
d) Pacemaker activity  

### Q5. In a 3-lead ECG, what is the role of the RL electrode?

a) Records signals from the heart  
b) Provides ground reference  
c) Detects noise  
d) Amplifies the P wave
